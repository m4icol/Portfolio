## About Me ü§Ø

I'm a web developer specializing in the front-end world and creating 3D illustrations.

I started creating web pages for fun at the age of 15, never imagining it would become one of my greatest passions.

Additionally, I learned to develop applications with Flutter for a school project and also acquired skills in programming with C++ and Java.
