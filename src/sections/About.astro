            <p>I'm a web developer specializing in the front-end world and creating 3D illustrations.</p>
            <p>I started creating web pages for fun at the age of 15, never imagining it would become one of my greatest passions.</p>
            <p>Additionally, I learned to develop applications with Flutter for a school project and also acquired skills in programming with C++ and Java.</p>
